# i18n
 i18n stands for internationalization, which is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. The "i18n" notation is derived from the word "internationalization," where "i" is the first letter, "18" represents the number of letters between "i" and "n," and "n" is the last letter. This notation is used as a shorthand to refer to internationalization.
