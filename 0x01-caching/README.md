## Caching
A caching system is a mechanism used to store copies of frequently accessed or expensive-to-compute data in order to speed up access to that data in the future.

In computing, caching systems are used at various levels of a system to improve performance. For example, web browsers use a cache to store copies of web pages, images, and other resources locally, so that when you revisit a page, the browser can load it more quickly by fetching resources from the local cache instead of from the internet.
